In this directory you will find a benchmark script "benchmark.pl"
that will test the performance of all Crypt::CBC compatible 
encryption modules available on CPAN at the time of this writing
(November 2003).  Of course, it will only test those modules that
are installed on your system.

The results are writting into an HTML file "benchmark.html" (and
other files linked from there).  The benchmarking is surely not
bullet-proof but the results should give you an idea of the
performance of the various modules on your(!) machine.  Please
note, that the performance of all modules can vary a lot depending
on the operating system and hardware.

The file "benchmark.html" shipped with Crypt::Twofish_PP shows the
results for one of my machines.  You should not over-estimate the
absolute numbers but rather see the results as a whole and only
compare the performance indicators relative to each other.

For more reliable results you will probably increase the time 
per test.  You can do that by modifying the constant "SECONDS"
in the source code of "benchmark.pl".

Improvements to the script (command-line options for more flexible
usage?) are welcome!
